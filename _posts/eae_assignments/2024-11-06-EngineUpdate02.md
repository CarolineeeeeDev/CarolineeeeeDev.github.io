## SDL import

I used SDL for controller support.

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

After downloading the dev version and put it into "External" folder under my solution, I set the include path and library directory in visual studio for my player input system project.
