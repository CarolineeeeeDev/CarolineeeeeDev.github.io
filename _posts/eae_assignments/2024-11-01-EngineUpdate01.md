## Overview

This week, I focused on adding a player input subsystem to the original engine, specifically implementing the following features:

- Replace the old user input system with the new player input system
- Key binding functionality
- Update player input
- Update game object position
- Update camera position
- Switch game object meshes
- Input for exiting game

## New player input system

The latest player input system can effectively replace the original user input system in `cMyGame`.

Additionally, it utilizes some methods from the previous user input system, such as `IsKeyPressed`, to detect when a player presses a specific key.

## Key Binding



## Update player input



## Update game object position



## Update camera position



## Switch game object meshes



## Input for exiting game
