The player input system will be a core part of the game engine, allowing other developers to efficiently manage player actions and controls for their games. Here’s how it will work:

### Overview and Features

The input system will manage input events and state tracking for keyboard and mouse. It will support:

1. **Input Mapping:** Define specific inputs (e.g., WASD, arrow keys) that control character movement or other game actions.
2. **Customizable Actions:** Assign game-specific actions to inputs, such as Jump, Shoot, or Interact.
3. **Real-time and Press/Release Events:** Distinguish between actions triggered by holding a button vs. tapping.
4. **Input Sensitivity and Dead Zones:** Customize sensitivity for smoother control (e.g., analog stick sensitivity or mouse movement).

### Usage for Final Project Games

To set up the input system, you would:

- **Create a Data File:** Define the actions you need and map each action to a specific input. This might look like a JSON or XML file where each key (or button) corresponds to an in-game action.
- **Use the Public Interfaces:** The system would offer classes like `InputManager` and `InputAction` that manage key bindings and check the current input state. You’d initialize `InputManager`, load your input data, and then use methods like `IsActionPressed("Jump")` to query actions during gameplay.

### Implementation Plans

I plan to:

- **Set up Input Bindings:** Design structures to define and store input mappings, and initialize mappings from data files.
- **Implement State Tracking:** Keep track of which keys are pressed, released, or held, and provide API calls to query these states.
- **Create a Configurable Interface:** Make it easy to change key bindings without altering code, using data-driven files.

### Anticipated Challenges and Stretch Goals

- **Event Precision Management**: Ensuring key press, release, and hold events are processed accurately without delay.
- **Handling Key Conflicts**: Managing instances when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously, ensuring no unexpected actions or conflicts arise.
- **Flexible Key Binding**: Providing an easy-to-use data format for users to customize key bindings and supporting dynamic reloading and updating of input configurations.
